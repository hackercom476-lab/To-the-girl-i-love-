# 💖 Happy Valentine’s Day, My Love 💖

## To my beautiful girlfriend 🌸

Hi love,

I don’t know how to put my feelings into perfect words,  
but I know this — **you are my favorite part of every day**.

You came into my life quietly,  
and somehow became my safest place,  
my biggest smile,  
and the reason my heart feels full 💗

If love were code,
you would be the part that never breaks,
never fails,
and always makes everything better.

### 🌹 Why I Love You
- Your smile makes my bad days disappear
- Your voice feels like home
- Your heart is the most beautiful thing I know
- Loving you feels natural, easy, and right
